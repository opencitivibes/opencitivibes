## 10. Device Trust (2FA Remember Device)

If you enable two-factor authentication (2FA), you may choose to trust a device to bypass the TOTP code entry on future logins.

**Data collected when trusting a device:**

- Device identifier (browser type, operating system)
- Anonymized IP address (subnet only, last octet removed)
- Trust creation date and expiry date
- Last usage date

**Purpose:**

- Reduce authentication friction while maintaining security
- Device trust ONLY bypasses TOTP code entry, NOT password authentication

**Duration:**

- You choose the trust duration (maximum 30 days)
- Trust automatically expires after the selected period
- Revoked devices are permanently deleted after 7 days

**Your rights regarding device trust:**

- **View**: Access a list of all your trusted devices at any time
- **Rename**: Give your devices friendly names for easy identification
- **Revoke**: Withdraw trust from any device immediately
- **Revoke all**: Remove trust from all devices at once

**Notifications:**

When you trust a device, you receive an email notification containing the device name, trust date, and expiry date. This ensures you are aware of all devices that can bypass 2FA.

**To manage your trusted devices:**

Visit Settings > Security > Trusted Devices, or contact us at {{contactEmail}}.

## 11. Contact and Complaints
